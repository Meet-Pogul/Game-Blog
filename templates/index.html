                            third-person or first-person perspective. Players complete missions—linear
                            scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Outside of the missions,
                            players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area,
                            including the fictional Blaine County, and the fictional city of Los Santos, the world is
                            much larger in area than earlier entries in the series. It may be fully explored after
                            the game's beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more gameplay
